# **Recommendation-Systems**

## **Introduction:**
This is a competition project has been done in fulfillment to the completion of Foundations and applications of Data Minig(INF553) course at University of Southern California. The work on the project was all done by myself.

The project objective is to build a hybrid recommendation engine by mixing recommendations from content-based filtering, user-based and item-based collaborative firltering recommendation models.

**In this project, all the Data Mining and recommendation algorithms are implemented without using any library**. Coding and implementing the algorithms without using libraries helps us in better understanding of them and use the algorithms as per our input data and requirements.

**I stood at third place in this competitive project in a class of 120 students and the rankings are given as per RMSE.**
