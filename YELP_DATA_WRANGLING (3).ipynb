Had trouble with ticketmaster so went directly to the Rio phone line for the show.  I am VERY disappointing for several reasons. There is a 50% coupon code that they did not tell me about or offer to me.  The tickets was OVER $200 EACH !  Now I will rate the show.  Some parts is outstanding but the rest is like something you get for free on a cruise line.  Nothing special.  I am upset with myself for choosing this one when there was so many other options.  I would not suggest anyone to go to WOW, what they show on the trailers is all the WOW you will get.This was very good show! Not a bad seat in the house! The performers were spectacular and there is something for everyone to enjoy! We had front row seats which were great but there were a few times during the show that I would recommend sitting a few rows back to get a  better view of everything on the stage. My only small complaint would be during the African dance scene maybe have some performers of color to make it more realistic. It was pretty obvious to myself and my guests that there was only one African onstage during that entire scene. Although we were very happy for the opportunity to see Mr. Oppong!Beautiful backdrop and great acts.  They do need a way to tie it together.  It is a new show.  It\\'s a small venue.  It\\'s not cirque and it\\'s not like absinthe but it\\'s a great show for the price.  It needs to be a little more cohesive since they jump from fairies to titanic.Truly is a spectacular show. I\\'ve watched it last night with my 5 year old son, he enjoyed it so much! The water element, the acrobats, the stunts and the screen - all are astonishing, giving the show it\\'s WOW factor. I was lacking some plot in order for it to make sense, some story that will tie everything together except the water element. But indeed a wonderful Vegas show!OMG OMG OMG!!!! That\\'s what I was saying basically the whole time!!! \\n\\nMy first show in Vegas! It was awesome!!!! \\n\\nThey had singing, dancing, acrobatics, & a bow an arrow!!! Also if you sit in the front you might get called on & get water splashed on you.\\n\\nReally nice & funny show for all ages. \\n\\nI got my tickets off Groupon they have a deal & when you check in they just scan the barcode when you click view voucher. \\n\\nThe show is inside the Rio hotel. You can park in the self parking lot. \\n\\nThey check your bags before you get in. After they scanned our barcodes another secure looked at our tickets to direct us where to sit. After everyone basically got seated and there\\'s empty spaces the security guard will tell you, you can move up more if you like. \\n\\nThe room is small but a good size. If more people show up they might have to find a different place to preform or they will just have booked shows which is good. \\n\\nAfter the show you can take pictures with some of the people performing.Oh my WOW is fabulous. Worth way more than the ticket cost. Non stop dancing and gymnastics and aerobics by beautiful men and women. Very professional and the choreography is top notch. If you enjoy America\\'s got talent you will love this show   There is one word to describe the show.  WOW. Do not miss this show. Fabulous. Fabulous fabulousThis is the family friendly version of absinthe meets O. There is some mild raunchy humor but otherwise kid friendly. My sister got me and my daughter front row VIP seats for free. \\n\\nThe acts were spectacular. The roller skating one made me nervous with the girl being whipped around in circles. The dancing and acrobats were amazing and well choreographed. I thought the nerdy guy was a bit annoying but he was leading the storyline.Incredible acts and amazing athletes.  The roller skating act scared me the most, just one wrong move and those girls are coming my way.  If you have ADD you will love this show!! No act lasts more than 5 minutes. \\nThe host (geek) was fantastic and made the show more enjoyable.\\n\\nPaying $6 ($7 with tip) for a small bottle of water is rediculuous\\n\\nLoved the show, don\\'t drink the water....Amazing show! I took my 6 year old granddaughter and she was in awe. One of the best shows I\\'ve ever seen. Don\\'t miss it!The rating is based on my overall experience.\\n\\nThe seating arrangement sucked.\\n\\nThe cast is talented.\\n\\nIt lacked a story because each act was unrelated.  \\n\\nHAVE TO AGREE with my fellow 3 star raters.I would probably say this is a 3.5. Some of the acts were great, but the overall show left me a little underwhelmed. Nothing against the actors, but I could personally do without the cheesy parts of the show. The little girl in front of me loved it though. I booked seats day if and ended up in the second row. It didn\\'t really seem like there is a bad seat. It\\'s a good show to see if you\\'ve seen the rest, but there are plenty of better ones in town.Amazing show for families or couples and friends. I was pretty entertained!  Bar inside is convenient. Acts were fun and energetic but our crowd sucked. Silvia Silvia was my favorite act but the pole couple, dancers, plate act, rollerskates, two girls and a ring act, mermaid act, all great! Locals must see!Excellent show and appropriate for all ages.  The costuming was fantastic and the colors were vibrant. The featured artists were very engaged and enthusiastic about their performance.  This is a show worth seeing.  The host and hostesses encouraged the audience to move into better seats when available.  They encouraged photography as long as it was not flash.  I truly enjoyed every minute of this show.  If you are in Las Vegas it is a must see.Had comp tickets to a Thursday night show. The tickets said 9pm but we started closer to 9:15 because it took them awhile to get everyone seated. The theater is fairly small so any seat is a pretty good seat, though I did notice there were some scenes that probably would\\'ve looked better if we were seated directly in the middle instead of off to the side where we were. \\n\\nThe show is basically an episode of America\\'s Got Talent. Just a hodgepodge of acts that didn\\'t really have a cohesive theme. It bounced around from pirates to the Titanic to the 80\\'s to an African safari, and then some. Some acts were more entertaining than others. My favorite act was the woman with the bow and arrows. \\n\\nIt\\'s sort of a family friendly show and my kiddo seemed to enjoy it, though she did say she was bored during some of the slower acts (the ones that had a more \"romantic\" theme). There were a few \"adult\" jokes/skits that weren\\'t kid-friendly, so keep that in mind. With all of the shows out there, this probably wouldn\\'t be my first choice.Las Vegas is entertainment. It is truly a high-energy environment and there are many shows to choose from. My Uber driver turned me onto the World of Wonder show at the Rio Casino Hotel. I continued to ask around and no one had heard of this show. I decided to buy two tickets for my girlfriend and I to check out this show. Tickets were $67. each and we were in the 2nd row. The seats were amazing and the bar was open throughout the show. The show contained Magic, Acrobats, Mermaids, Comedy, Dancing and much more. It is truly a world of wonder. A good place to purchase tickets is tixtonight.com located all over the strip in kiosk machines. \\nEveryone should see this show!\\nCheersEh. That pretty much sums up the show. \\n\\nI wanted to do a low-key Vegas weekend and not spend too much money. With this goal in mind, we saw a few show tickets on Groupon and the bf chose \"WOW\" as his preferred option. We decided to get the \"middle level\" seats - not to spend too much, but not to be too cheap either.\\n\\nOnce we got to the theater, there was a super long line to get in. I immediately asked out loud if there was assigned seating, because the line was reminiscent of first come first serve. The bf assured me that our seats were chosen ahead of time, though we heard a few other later arrivals exclaiming and asking the exact same thing upon seeing the queue. \\n\\nThe theater wasn\\'t filled to capacity, so the ushers chose to move everyone forward. Everyone\\'s seats were upgraded, and those in the \"cheap\" zones were moved to the middle zone. This was disappointing, because we could have saved a bit of money and sat in the same place. I felt bad for the people in the front who paid more, or full price, because the view wasn\\'t that much better. Also, there were a couple guys in front of us that kept getting splashed with water, and who looked rather unhappy about this.\\n\\nThe theater itself had three projects of \"living\" screens - one in the middle and one on each side. The one on the right was out of focus the entire time. It was behind us, so I didn\\'t care, but I thought that was lame for the people across the stage from us who had to stare in that direction. The show is pretty new, so that shouldn\\'t have been an issue.\\n\\nAll of the dance scenes were blah. I actually felt myself cringing every time one started. Also, the musical choices were odd. Very odd and very loud. I didn\\'t really like how they used random renditions of songs. Many of the costumes were slightly over the top. \\n\\nThe performances themselves weren\\'t bad. I\\'ve seen all of those moves before at other Cirque shows, and nothing beat anything thus far. Probably the most impressive, in my opinion, was the couple on stage climbing the central pole and dropping down, face first, within inches of hitting the floor. I thought they did a great job. \\n\\nWe ate a really large dinner beforehand, and I was honestly having trouble staying awake during the performance. It was something to do, but I wished we had used our money in a more enjoyable way. It\\'s too bad, as well, because this show got so many positive reviews.This was such a good show...and the price is fair. I would suggest checking to see if there are deals on groupon to get an even better price. I would say this show is comparable to some Cirque du Soleil performances without the crazy ticket prizes and elaborate stage. \\n\\nThe show was over an hour long and it consisted of different performances based on music. Most of the performers also incorporated water into some form in the act. If you don\\'t want to get wet, I would suggest not getting seats in the front.  \\n\\nThe performers were VERY impressive. Just like other reviewers have mentioned, there were acts in this show that I had never seen before. I also enjoyed the comedian (reminded me of Charlie Chaplin as he did not speak). He was funny and kept the crown entertained as we waited for the following act.  This is definitely a family friendly show but even adults would enjoy it. I recommend you go see it with the family!Great show.   It has so many different things in the show.   The titantic was so amazing.  And the pole dancers.   What a great show.  Thank you so muchReally good variety show at the Rio that got several wows and laughs out of me. \\n\\nVery talented entertainers. The stage and special effects were just okay but the stunts and skillful acts are the main attraction. \\n\\nThe seating could be improved several ways, needed more space between chairs and the angle wasn\\'t ideal most the time so I had my head cranked to the left for most the show. \\n\\nOverall the four of us enjoyed the show and would recommend it to others.I didnt realize what i was watching until it was just about over. After 90 minutes i realized it was a talent show that takes place on a stage with ankle deep water. It was entertaining, but felt like i was watching Americas Got Talent at  Disenyland. Id go back once they fix a few things below. \\n\\nThe visuals, enormous projection screen and holograms are great.  The music was a bit off for many for many of the acts and stopped before the performer was done. They need live singers for many parts of this show to increase engagement. The cohesion throughout the show is lacking: you have live talent acts, a group of dancers and a guy that comes on throughout the sets to entertain and he just comes off annoying because he comes out a lot! Felt like i was watching three shows in one. \\n\\nA few tips: dont arrive late because the opening scene is amazing. Dont sit on the sides of the theater because much of the shows 3 d visuals and acts are for those sitting in the center of the theater. Dont sit on the front sides unless you want to get wet.So I ended up here with VIP Seats and didn\\'t know what to expect. So I came in with an open mind and figured why not enjoy a Vegas Variety Show...\\n\\nLets just say I caught myself saying WOW throughout the night.\\n\\nI was literally up front and personal with all the talent and enjoyed each act.\\n\\nThe visual aspect was almost 3D.\\n\\nThe music was excellent.\\n\\nThe show was a total surprise!\\n\\nWhether you pay for your seats or get them as a comp, you\\'ll enjoy the show.\\n\\nIt is an hour and a half of non stop entertainment.\\n\\nI would watch it again.\\n\\nThe comedy, the choreography and the suspense of the combined acts seriously is WOW!I am going to start this review with some context. I am a Vegas local and we have seen all of the Cirque shows that are resident and that come through. So I do have a high bar.\\n\\nWhen you first walk into WOW, the theater is really intimate and inviting. There are big screens all around with nature scenes, a big central fountain, and sound effects. Loved it! The show started with a really annoying clown. Now, the Cirque shows always have clowns and their clowns are always funny and bring cohesiveness between the acts during set changes. This clown was annoying, cliche, and every time he came out I think most of the audience just wanted him gone. The show started off a bit slow, with some sub-par costuming and the most predictable songs you could imagine. At points I downright felt like I had accidentally booked tickets to a children\\'s show - like the pirate songs. The acrobats were MUCH better and the dance numbers and background music definitely improved substantially after the first 20 minutes or so (basically once the pirate act is over you\\'re in the clear). The roller skating act and archer were amazing, all of the acrobats were talented, and I saw a few things that I have never seen in Cirque shows too! Overall, the acrobats/skaters/stars were all 5/5 top notch but the background choreography, music selections, and most costuming felt cheap and cliche (3/5). I suggest buying the ~$70 seats in the outer circle as opposed to the closer seats which cost twice as much for almost the same view.This show was fantastic. I hadn\\'t heard much about it when I saw it, but it was engaging from beginning to end. I\\'ve seen almost all Vegas performance shows, and I would put this one in my Top 5 and I wouldn\\'t hesitate to see it again or take new friends to it.  Check it out!Excellent show to go to. Very entertaining, amazing, and a good variety of acts that will keep you on your toes and interested. One of the better Vegas shows I have been to. The people in the acts are so talented and top notch. Go see this show, five stars!Loved this show!  Having been to some bigger ones in Vegas, I can\\'t say this was jaw-dropping or anything.  However, it\\'s great for a wide age range, and definitely has some awesome stunts.  I had a hard time deciding which shows to see on a recent trip because someone in my party was visiting internationally, so they didn\\'t appreciate some of the jokes in the comedy shows.  This ended up being a great choice because there\\'s not a lot of dialogue.  Just really fit performers flying around the stage, with the occasional splash or two.  As a bonus, there wasn\\'t an incredibly long line to get in because of the size of the theater!Lat night, 03 October 2017, was the US premier of the new show at the Rio Hotel for Wow.  This is part water show--no diving or fancy things like that--and it\\'s a mixture of variety acts.  \\n\\nThe show starts with the cast being \"caught\" by a fisherman and coming up on hooks out of the water.  From there, you have acts that use the water such as the Singing in the Rain segment or the pirate section.\\n\\nWhile the curtain is shut to prepare the stage for the next water involved act, your attention is drawn to a circular stage in front.  There, a variety of acts go on--roller skaters, juggling, hoop acrobatics, and others.\\n\\nThe show is aided by the use of wonderful projections on 3 large LED screens that augment the sections with great scenes.  These were there before but they have really used the to the fullest.  One of the most delightful things is that while some scenes are displayed at the back of the stage, there is a scrim in front of the stage and on it are projected different things.  This gives an aura of 3D and it\\'s very well done.\\n\\nThis show is fast paced, funny at times, and filled with a variety of acts.  I don\\'t want to describe much more because I don\\'t want to give away some of the things that happen.  Suffice it to say that this is a little \\'O\\', a little G rated Absinthe, and a little V Variety show.\\n\\nThe cast was outside the theatre last night for photos.  When they have two shows per evening, I\\'m not sure they\\'ll have the time to do that.  This is a nice addition to entertainment in Las Vegas and a reason to go to the Rio.\\n\\nA couple of suggestions:  Park at the Masquerade Tower garage.  It\\'s closer to the theatre than the other garage along Valley View.  Parking is FREE for everyone at the Rio and there are no ticket dispensing machines nor gates to slow you down.\\n\\nAs for seating, I had a front row Vip section seat.  I\\'d recommend sitting away from the stage than up close.  I had to stare up several times during the show.  Since the showroom is not a huge place, sitting several rows back would be good.Amazing show!!!\\nI really didn\\'t know what to expect from this show and I didn\\'t hear much about it. My family and I were literally exploring the RIO hotel & casino when we looked over and seen a theater that said \"WOW\". The billboard next to it showed a preview of what the \"World of Wonder\" consist of. I saw acrobats and water stunts and immediately though oh this show might be like the Le\\'reve at the Wynn which was my all time favorite Las Vegas show, but not until I watched \"World of Wonder\"!!\\n\\n\"Discounted tickets\"\\nWe ended up purchasing our tickets at Las vegas TOWN SQUARE You\\'ll find Tix4Tonight at the mall at Town Square, located right across from the Claim Jumper Restaurant at 6605 South Las Vegas Boulevard. Starting as low as $40!! We bought $44+tax ($54/per) 2nd to the back last row and the crew moved us closer 4th to the front stage for free talk about the Best deals!!!\\n\\n\"Show review\"\\nThe 90-minute spectacular was completely memorizing. It definitely took the Las Vegas shows to a new level!! A customized showroom at the\\xa0Rio Las Vegas\\xa0complete with performance pool, it will make you say \"WOW\". So much talent, humor, beauty and very detailed performers was just Incredible!!\\n\\nParking at the RIO is FREE which is a plus since majority of the casinos you have to pay for parking.We received discount tickets for this show. Overall, it is entertaining, but nothing new. For the most part, the acts are high quality, but there are a few odd dance numbers (strange Titanic sinking one?) that left us confused. The background is a big moving screen that is reminiscent of an early 00\\'s screensaver background. \\n\\nAlso, getting tired of the played-out Italian stereotypes still being used. Not clever, lazy characterization, and veering towards offensive. \\n\\nI think, at a discount, it makes for a fun evening. However, I don\\'t think the full price admission is competitive given the content of the show. For not too much more you could see a Cirque show on the strip. Granted, you won\\'t get a small theater with up close seats like here, but it will be more of a Vegas spectacle.It\\'s a variety show for whole family, and better than most of the show on the Strip! It has dancers, roller skaters, air gymnasts, comedians and all kind of performers, including human water fountain and lady shooting arrows... costumes are just amazing, like Curque di Soleil quality, and performance great as well!!! Amazing show, way better than expected and worth every penny and more!!! It\\'s just unbelievable great!!! I will go again!!!  Stunning, spectacular, fantastic!!! Great for kids and adults, even a seniors love it! (I bring one of each with me as guests(; ). I\\'m so happy I went!!!OMG this show was totally PHENOMENAL.  The acrobats, arrow shooter, host, okay soooo EVERYTHING was absolutely AMAZING. The cast expresses gratitude after the show.  I would bring everyone that visits me here in Las Vegas to this show.  \\n\\nForget about the price, because you will receive more than your money worth.  Honestly the show could have easily cost more and I would have been satisfied (says the cheap one).  Let me say this your loss if you miss WOW.\\n\\n\\nIf ever in Vegas the new show \"Wow\" is like Wwwoooooww!  #wowlasvegas #puretalentLet me give you the truth.\\nThis is a NOT a cirque show at all. So once we are all clear with that I can move on.....\\n\\nIt\\'s a decent show with a few great performances. Some of the acts are one of a kind and some of them are kinda a what? Lol. I was WOWED at the Bow performance,\\nThe plates and the rollerskating. \\n\\nJust go and try to have a good time. We were sold this performance as better than O.....and it lead to my overall disappointment. I would not return sadly.4.5 stars\\n\\nI\\'ve seen a lot of shows in Vegas, so it\\'s difficult to find something that will impress me. \\n\\nPros: awesome variety, entertaining, terrific seats all around (we sat so close it almost felt awkward), photos are allowed (but turn off your flash and don\\'t block those behind you), neat costumes\\n\\nCons: very similar to Absinthe but without the nudity and profanity\\n\\nOverall, glad we saw it. The best part was the lady with the bows and arrows. Don\\'t blink!!!What an amazing show! Colorful, energetic and lots of fun. I said WOW multiple times. If you haven\\'t seen it yet you definitely should.Sorry hardcore gamers. Its not a show about World Of Warcraft. That would have been interesting. \\n\\nAnyways, this show has a little bit of everything. Good for all ages. You got juggling, roller skating, dancing, pirates, statues that shoot water from their crotch and chest, an Italian chef spinning a bunch of bowls on a table simultaneously, mermaids swinging their hair back splashing water, some chick with a crossbow shooting targets, acrobatic acts which were with a pole, bungees, and a hula hoop all being done in the middle of the air. Oh, and water, lots of water involved. There is even a quick rendition of the dance scene from Titanic with the ballroom filling with water which ends in the ship sinking. \\n\\nThats pretty much the show. Surprised they didnt call it World Of Water with all the water involved. I like how the well the stage is set up. I dont think it matters where you sit. Good views all around. I also like how they have the background around the stage set up with LCD screens that immerse you in just about any environment they can come up with.\\n\\nI highly recommend this show. Just me describing it does not do it any justice. So come on down to the Rio and check it out! Bonus is that you dont have to pay for parking!\\n\\nYelp 2018 Review #32 \\n701 overallMy rating is more for the quality of the seats than the actual show itself. \\nThe show itself is great. A lot of different acts and very entertaining. \\n\\nI obtained my seats through my house seats membership. The theater was half empty and they sat us on the side and in the back. The theater was half empty. The seats in the back were stuck together with no space between them. My seat was next to the audio control station and I was pressed against it the whole time   \\n\\nI asked if we could be moved as the show was starting  and the attendant said there were still people coming in.  But everyone has been seated. One of the attendants moved some people around but they never moved us.   I was so uncomfortable that it truly made it hard to enjoy the show.\\n\\nThe show was great and I\\'d love to see it again. Why would the theater  push us to the back and sides ? It makes no sense.Disappointing.  The story line was predictable and amateurish, but the set was beautiful and the performers were very talented and did an amazing job!I usually don\\'t go to many shows in Las Vegas, but my wife talked me into this one. Glad she did...it was well done and unique enough for me to enjoy it, unique like the old Siegfried and Roy, or Cirque D Solei, just a smaller venue but very good visuals. How good was it? I would go again, and that says a lot. If you would rather see transvestites, Elvis impersonators or old hacks from the 70\\'s, don\\'t waste the big bucks to see this. On the other hand if you like an interesting pleasant show, then I think you will like WoW. I did. My wife raved about it!Amazing show! Performers were great! Never a dull moment! We will go again for sure! The music is amazing, the 3D backdrop was incredible. We had purchased back row seats and the host at the door gave us V.I.P. Seats in the front row.Amazing show !!!!!!!! Good job Hanoch rozen! Proud that Israeli show came to las vegas. This is absolutely astounding show very talented dancers !!! Maladitz!!!!!Way better than we expected- funny, entertaining, theatrical- we loved every second!! Highly recommended!!!Very nice show a lot different acts .\\nReally god job by all the performer\\'s considering it is an small stage not disingne to do big circle de solie kind of shows but in general a great atrccion for the of the strip casino \\nAt the end the frendly staff go outside to take photograph great that you can see them up close and personal..lol\\n\\nOnly one cons \\nWe move few sits to our left after the show star On the Role all away in the back The Usher or security guy  have a big trolling about that .\\nBeing rude tell us to have to move back to our seats By the way the seat remained empty for the rest of the show I guess you want to sit for himself The show is less than 2 hours long and you had to sit down .Yes look at the pictures3 1/2 stars. Very good new show in Vegas. This show is more liked the V show in Planet Hollywood but better. The 3D background is excellent unless your seat is at the very edge of the showroom. The show is fun and inexpensive compared to the other shows in Vegas. The showroom is not too big. You don\\'t have to pay for the best seats closed to the stage as long as you don\\'t take the seats located in the left or right side edge of the showroom. The chairs is the only reason why they received three and half stars from my review only. I would-en give them five stars if they can upgrade the chairs. They are use the cheap restaurant or office chairs just put it side by side. the chair is hard and no armrest. This is making the show less enjoyable. I hope Rio can fix this problem by next time when I am there again!Simply amazing show!  I was fully entertained throughout the show and even found myself holding my breath through some of it as well.\\n\\nWe had second row from the stage seats which were good unless someone tall is sitting in front of you.  The seating is probably the most concerning part and wished they had a put a little more thought into it.  If you are ground level you may have an obstructed view, so if possible select seats that are elevated.\\n\\nAll of the acts were entertaining and some had me on the edge of my seat literately. Some I recognized from the show \"Americas Got Talent\".  I highly recommend seeing this show.   I honestly did not come with high expectations, but that quickly changed and i kept thinking of how impressed I was through out the show.My wife and I go to a lot of shows in Las Vegas . We went to see WOW recently with some friends . While in line one of my wife\\'s friends said said she had heard bad things about this show from her friends . Well the bottom line is that we all had a great time at WOW . This is an entertaining show . If you like music , comedy and some variety acts this a good  show . WOW WOW WOWJust came upon I  this because of my diamond status at total rewards at harrahs.Com. I have to say the performers and the music were incredible.  A must see in vegas.The show and music are good. Spend extra for the middle seat or go with the cheapest and sit all the way in the back so you can see the whole stage otherwise you\\'re trying to look around at everything going on and it\\'s easy to miss something.This a new show in Las Vegas and I highly recommend it. Outstanding production, new and daring acts, handsome and beautiful entertainers\\n, etc. Wow your money. Go see it.Very nice show. Good for the whole family. The costumes in the beginning are pretty amazing. It was a good fun show with various acts and beautiful cast members. My grandmother gets a kick out of the main character. It was great to see her laugh and have such a good time. This was the 4th time her and my mother saw the show they like it a lot and they see shows all over town all the time.Saw this show for my bday Vegas trip 1/20/18. It was fantastic, i highly recommend it to anyone who likes Cirque du Soleil style shows. The show is water themed but there or other parts that are totally dry. The music, dancing and singing are great. It\\'s a small venue so every seat is a good seat, so dont feel like u need to pay alot for a ticket. Of course there\\'s a bar inside, drinks were nice and strong. I would definately see it again.WOW is fantastic!  It\\'s a must see. The show is imaginative, the costumes are beautiful and the acts are amazing. I\\'m so glad we saw it.  I hope lots of people go to see it so the show can stay. The show is appropriately named -- WOW!This show is great for all ages if you are looking for any kid friendly options in Las Vegas. Don\\'t expect real singing because everything was lip-synced, which was a bummer. However, all the acts were amazing and the people were extremely talented! The show definitely had some heart stopper moments which made the audience scream \"WOW\"!  My favorite act was the trio on roller skates. Absolutely awesome, have to go see it to believe it!I saw this show for the second time today.  Not sure if I missed the intro the first time or didn\\'t know where the story was going or what the demographic was.   I disliked the main character and his acting the first time.   It did all wrap up in the end the first time.  I also thought it was a little disneyfied the first time.   The second time, I completely got it and it was a very well done show.  I also saw it opening week the first time.  I should note, I actually love Disney.  Just didn\\'t know what the show was about.  I also disliked the mystere qualities of the main character a bit and thought it lacked originality and was trying to do a knockoff show.  And it somewhat is, but the show does develop a full story by the end that stands alone.  \\n\\nI also watch agt and recognize that it is a showcase for the acts.  I thought the use and tie in of all the acts, the water and storyline is pretty good. \\n\\nAnd loved the use of the digital screen.   It added so much to the show.  Almost on a ka, my favorite show of all time, level.   \\n\\nMain criticism, the skaters (while very good) are not the most nuanced.  Again, I love all the skaters, so I\\'ve studied them a bit.  Beyond too cool, but also felt that the show actually was good for a family show in vegas and there was no need for the thonged butt cheeks the skater girls.  The talent and tricks stood alone without the eye candy and 5 years old don\\'t need to see naked girls.  \\n\\nOtherwise, the show was great for kids and adults. Sex doesn\\'t have to always be on display.  The show was without any blatant sexuality without this one issue...yes, a few undertones and many beautiful figures were shown...just with costumes and no butt cheeks.  It didn\\'t add to the show, yet made an issue for parents and the show is ages five and up.  There were plenty of \"adult insinuations\" Disney style that were for parents and not children.Great show and a lot of fun.  I was surprised at the quality of the performers people I\\'ve seen on America\\'s got talent and another shows in Vegas definitely worth checking out really good I would definitely go backDang these people work hard for their money!  Having seen 5 Cirque shows, I think this is a great option for people who don\\'t want to splash $100+ for a show & want to bring their family to a Vegas performance that errs on the more \"classic circus\" side than higher brow \"O\" at the Bellagio show.  For the price (around $45), I\\'d definitely come back & treat a couple people to tickets.  The ushers were awesome: I was supposed to be seated in row J, but was invited to sit in row D.  Off to the side was a better view of the show.\\n\\nThe people here on Yelp who complained about the acts being cheesy or offensive...... need to lighten up!  It\\'s an acrobatic circus show & these performers need time backstage to change/heal/recover!  Geez man, it\\'s a show not a political rally.  Get a drink.  Grab some candy or popcorn.  If you go to the other Vegas shows, you\\'d see the similarities between how the performance acts are spaced out.  Until the day you can shoot 8 arrows to hit an apple at the top of your head like Sylvia Syliva (who, by the way..... is #GOALS for staying in such fabulous shape), I suggest you just chill out & enjoy the show.\\n\\nThanks for the performers who came out & took pictures after!  You guys are really some of the hardest working people here in Vegas show business.This show was beyond amazing! I\\'ve seen so many shows in Las Vegas & this was by far the best show I\\'ve ever seen!!! Way more than I expected out of a show. I plan on going back to see it again!!!Great show at the Rio. It\\'s been around for about a year now. It\\'s a beautiful show that is kid-friendly. The tickets are also affordable. For the best seats, I would choose one right in the middle facing the stage. If you are off to the side, you will miss certain parts of the show. The cast does not sing, they lip synced, but the dancing, theatrics, tricks and other sets are awesome to see. They have a wide variety of talented dancers. My favorite is the roller skaters. There were other parts that actually made people in the audience say WOW! \\n\\nYou should go see it to fully enjoy and appreciate it. There\\'s also kind of a story line to follow that was cute and funny.Entertaining show for young and old alike with acrobatics, dancing, comedy as well as markswoman with a crossbow.  Well worth the price of admission and there\\'s not a bad seat in the house.Good show but I was a bit confused what the point of all of it was. It was such a hodgepodge of weirdness and no cohesive theme I left a bit confused as to what it was I saw.  I was entertained though, and that\\'s really all that matters when seeing a show in Vegas ehh? I am not sure I\\'d pay to see the show but if I did I wouldn\\'t feel as screwed as some of the other cheap shows I\\'ve seen have left me feeling.  The show has a lot of talent you just have to go into it knowing it\\'s just a bit of a variety show that never comes together as a theme.Just saw the show last night. Was impressive with a panoramic backdrop projection system that adds to the show. All the performers are very talented. Some very unique. One performer drinks 2 liters of water and does a human water fountain trick as part of the show. Later a women lines up seven cross bows and fires the eighth to start a chain reaction that shoots the last arrow into an apple on her head. Then they have one performer on roller skates spinning with a girl dangling from a head harness who is herself spinning. The other performers were great as well but not as unique. Several acrobat themes with the giant rings and two ladies in them doing impressive tricks. Added juggling and plate spinning. Heck they even managed to get a Chinese you yo in there. I think there is a back story but with all the action who cares. Music was clear for a lively soundtrack. Andi finally there is a great cast of dancers which perform throughout and did a great final number dancing in the water area with excellent lighting and waterfall trick. Overall good entertainment with almost no boring parts. If you don\\'t like this show not sure what you would as it has everything.Very disappointed with the show. The people performing do have talents however the way its displayed needs to be improved. There is way too much lag time in between acts so you\\'re left with this awful slapstick comedy routine from some one man act, those parts of the show were the worst! The whole experience honestly left me with the impression that these folks couldn\\'t make it in a Cirque or Le Reve show so they all got together and made up this B rate, cruise ship style, dog & pony show routine. Even the seating was awful, it was regular straight back chairs, not theater style seating. \\n\\nDo not splurge for expensive seats, the cheap seats are just as good, the theater is small! If you have kids I may recommend it as it is a budget friendly show. If not, spend the extra money and go see Le Reve or one of the Cirque shows & be truly amazed!  Based on the reviews & knowing its at the Rio I definitely expected a much grander experience.We really enjoyed WOW, one of the newest shows in Las Vegas. A high energy show at the Rio. It\\'s a variety show with dancing, juggling, singing and circus type performers. Colorful costumes and a lot of splashing around. Great visual effects on 3 gigantic backdrops. There are no bad seats in this intimate theater.A lot better than I expected. It\\'s an amazing variety show that\\'s great for all ages. There\\'s humor, acrobatics, dancing, and a whole bunch of other incredible feats. I would definitely go see it again.Saw this 2 nights ago and it was ok. It\\'s a cheaper show so I would say it\\'s worth it\\'s money but definitely not something. I would rave about or recommend to others. I think this show is based off of the people who win the TV show Americans got talent or one like it. It\\'s a bunch of skits they try and tie together but you have jugglers, spinners, dancers, jokesters and an older lady who is deadly with a crossbow. It was cool to see but if you can afford a different show, go to it insteadLoved this show, and will take friends from out of town when they visit. It is one of the few family friendly shows that I have seen and I would take even my youngest grandchild to see it. If you like comedy, acrobatics, music, dancing and surprises you should see this show. For almost 2 hours we were entertained, and it never felt too long. All the entertainers were so talented, the music was great, and the comedy kept us laughing.We saw WOW last night, and it was so much fun. It has a nice variety of acts and kept us entertained the entire show. I thought it was pretty G-rated overall, and would take kids to see this show. It felt a little Cirque du Soleil, a little Absinthe, with a bit of a Disney stage show thrown in. There are so many talented entertainers in this show. Our favorite was probably the woman with the bow & arrow-- breathtaking. The big LED screens throughout the theater were really great and set the mood. We will definitely take out-ot-town visitors to see this show. We were so pleasantly surprised and hope it\\'s successful.Wow!!! What a WONDERFUL and also totally unique and somewhat WEIRD show!! Very entertaining, great for kids and adults.  I have seen a lot of top performers here in vegas in Cirque shows and others, but this one was WAY up there.  All the dif types of performers were each so talented and there were some very unique and sometimes dangerous acts that I\\'ve never seen before.  Overall so much fun!  The sets/props were not the most hi tech, but very cooool and just...something different than I\\'ve seen before.  \\nTip: the best seats in my opinion would be in the center of the theater, about 4 rows back from the front, because (here come the negatives...)\\nthe theater is like 270 degrees around, but sometimes the acts are not fully visible from the sides, like where I was seated.  There are times where the curtains are not fully opened, and I\\'m not sure why since you could tell they weren\\'t hiding any stuff back there.  Also, there were many times where there was so much interesting stuff happening in the background, that I almost missed the bigger stuff in the foreground.  This along with a few other technical things like how the music was a bit too loud, sometimes emphasized by periods of NO music jumping to SUPER loud.  Being picky, I found a few other little technical things but I imagine if you\\'re not a former performer yourself, and haven\\'t seen so many dif great quality shows like I have, you probably wouldn\\'t notice.  I wanted to give the show a 4.5 rating, but since I couldn\\'t, I gave it 5 stars...because the good aspects of this show were SOOOOOOO goood!\\nOverall, def worth seeing.Great acts put together in one show including talents from America\\'s got talent. The venue was nice and small so all seats were great.Great show! Not a bad seat in the house. Variety of acts from dancing and acrobatics to roller skating and crossbow shooting. Would recommend to catch this one if you can!I have seen every show on the strip at least 3 times. This show however at the Rio called \"WOW\" was one of the worse I have ever seen. First off. The seats were HORRIBLE. I could not see most of the show and the parts I did see was only because I had to stand up and look around the wall I was sitting next to. This show is catered to center stage and those in the front row. If your sitting to the left or right of the stage in the corner you won\\'t see anything. What a waste of my money. Do yourself a favor for the same price and go see a show on the strip and trust me you will enjoy it more.  Horrible horrible experience. So disappointed. I expected more from Caesars Entertainment.It was an amazing experience.well put together a wonderful performance from all of the actsExcellent show, great variety of acts. Had you on the edge of your chair the whole show. I would go back and see this one again!!This is so far one of my favorite shows, the talent was awesome, the choreography and side acts were terrific especially the arrow act was tremendous\\nI would recommend this to all my friends and family \\nFor 90 minutes it keeps your attention.\\nSomething to see againWhat a wonderful night,\\nExcellent, Exciting and unlike anything else in Vegas.\\nMy friends and I had the most unbelievable night out thanks to WOW\\'S wonderful performers.\\nIf you are looking for something exciting to see in Vegas go see World of Wonder now playing at the RIO.....I mean WOW. That\\'s all I can really say. I was drawn in the first mermaid scene. Everyone in this show is absolutely amazing and beautifully talented. I was def on the edge of my seat half of the shows. Simply amazingI think the show is great! Performers are amazing and a hard working talent. Enjoyed the show and would recommend to see.Checked out the WOW - World of Wonder show at Rio Las Vegas with a corporate group. \\n\\nTheater was easy to locate. Staff were quick at processing us into the venue and helpful at locating our seats. \\n\\nVenue has a panoramic, digital video board display. Used to set background and theme elements.\\n\\nShow is full of talented acrobats, an archer, skaters and dancers. As well as a few comedians. This is a combination variety show and loosely strung \\'dream sequence\\' performed to music. About an hour-long show.\\n\\nBreath taking imagery. Heart-racing stunts. Ornate costumes.\\n\\nSeats were in tiers. Front chairs, lower tables, mid booths and upper chairs.\\n\\nVenue features bar service.\\n\\nA great show which left me saying wow on more than one occasion.I give this show two big thumbs down. This was less of a Las Vegas production and more like a community college show with a high school AV club behind the scenes. The performers seemed lost and unsure of what they were doing. If your looking for a nice evening out, spend the extra money and go to a cirque show. It may be twice the price, but the show is worth it.Didn\\'t expect the show to be so great!Better then Cirque du Soleil!Please go and see it for yourself!Holy. Cow!! I\\'ve seen a ton of shows and they all were kind of the same...BUT NOT THIS ONE!!! Absolutely INCREDIBLE!!! The lady shooter?!?  The rolled skaters?!?! OMG!! This show had me on the edge of my seat and my heart was RACING!! My jaw stayed dropped and I almost had to cover my eyes for some stunts because they were so dangerously crazy!!! WOW!! SERIOUSLY WOW!!!In-laws came to town. Needed a family type show. This is great choice. Awesome. Good deals on tickets too. A really good mix of talented people. Started off a little slow but once it started...WOW. I would see that again actually. Good job.We seen WoW earlier this month and all I can say is WoW! Will definitely go back and see it again. Not sure how they did allot of the water acts. And it\\'s not just water acts. It had a little bit of everything. America\\'s Got meets Cirque du Soleil.  It\\'s a must see!Despite the splashy, 3D set I am forced to give this show 3 stars, mostly due to highly offensive gestures by the clown towards a young lady in the audience.\\nSpoilers below, so if you want to be surprised by the show or antics of this nerdy, Jerry Lewis like character do not read.  \\n\\nSo the show begins with the above mentioned personage walking on stage wanting to catch some fish.  This boring skit went on too long; then we get some 3D images on screens, splashy costumes, some dance routines, ok fine, as we are on with the show...\\n...When this skit ends, we are treated to a bizzare boring pirate skit which went on too long.  Some pirate throws his hats into the air and they fly back to him.  Ok.  Boring stuff...\\n...Then we got some Italian Venetia skit, which was fine as 3D was involved, some African animals walk by; ok, then some Titanic skit with actors drowning, offensive as 1200 people drowned, why show it?  What\\'s next a 9/11 skit?\\nThen some fat man shows up with a huge rear, who twirls plates;  Why?  Because that\\'s what fat people do.\\nThen some needless splashing of the audience in the front 3 rows...\\nThen the nerd comes back, and here is where it gets really offensive.  So he juggles some bricks, pinches his finger, and asks a young lady to kiss it, fine.  Then he falls on stage, hurts his nose, comes back to same lady, asks to kiss the nose, she does, fine... then, as he jumps back on stage, he falls on his male organ(yes, the one between his legs), screams, and yes, comes back to same young lady, and asks her to kiss it by pointing at it.   \\nThen we get a 60 year old woman named Silvia Silvia in a real skimpy outfit that shows her butt, shooting arrows.  No big deal here.\\nAt the end of this big mess, the nerd comes back, turns around, takes off his mask and costume, and he is revealed to be a handsome middle aged man.  Gasp, ooh, all were shocked.  Shocked I say!  Then a young blonde barbie-doll half his age comes dancing out, and they set off into the sun-set together holding hands.  Lesson is if you are a nerd you could turn into a handsome man if you go off fishing, oh, and you get a blonde to go.  The End.\\nYes, Wow! is better and splashier than V The Show, but too long, offensive and boring at times.I had a chance to check out this show on a gut instinct since I wanted to see a Water show in Vegas and I was not leaving until I see one. I saw the billboard all over the Rio. I purchased a voucher and Travelzoo and Caesars Box office confirmed it. The theater is a small circle or semi circular theater inside the Rio. I was surprised that I loved this show a  lot. Well, to be honest I thought it was kinda boring in the beginning but it gets better after like 2-3 acts. It\\'s a variety types of acts from Pirates Themed, to Roller Skates, that Silvia lady doing archery shooting the balloons, the male/female cirque act on the pole. Anyway, I thought it was very memorable for a show in Vegas. It\\'s up and coming, it\\'ll be up there closing in to one of the Cirque du Soleil shows. The casts meet you outside to take photos at the billboard. They were hogged by everyone lol. Anyway, I\\' was glad to see this show. You should go too if you are ever at the Rio. :)The show was not sold out . We got there 20 minutes  early but you do  need to be there early. Show started about 20 minutes  late . The stage was very close to all seats. Back ground  was colourful.  Music was upbeat and lively.  Acrobats  were exciting  and very close up. A lot of beautiful  people. Seats were comfortable.  Enjoyed the showWho needs Cirque de Soleil? These guys are tops. The choreography, acrobatics and humor were fabulous, and I\\'m a really tough sell. Even the clown--I don\\'t like clowns--was mesmerizing and a show-stealer. I thought it was an excellent, excellent production. So beautiful and awe-inspiring.They have a talented cast, but the directing needs review.  When you read the show\\'s description, you may notice nothing specific.  I believe that\\'s because the show is chaos.  The audience is distracted from the main performance by background dancing and visual displays.  The talent is real: it does not need a ridiculous story and a dance troupe.  Let them shine!    Crazy components:   Titanic piece is weird: the audience watches the performers drown as the ship sinks, the costumes and music do not match the stories\\' time periods, the show is oversexualized, and tries too hard to mimic a cirque format.  I don\\'t see this show lasting unless there is a serious rewrite.Excellent show and appropriate for all ages.  The costuming was fantastic and the colors were vibrant. The featured artists were very engaged and enthusiastic about their performance.  This is a show worth seeing.  The host and hostesses encouraged the audience to move into better seats when available.  They encouraged photography as long as it was not flash.  I truly enjoyed every minute of this show.  If you are in Las Cegas it is a must s\\nShowBest show ever ! A must see for sure \\nI seen it 5 times from day one and will continue to go when I have the opportunity.\\nPlease if you visit Vegas don\\'t miss this great show no regrets promise !\\n\\nPor favor si visitan Las Vegas vean WOW. Número uno show del año les gustaráGreat show. Some acts on par or better than Cirque du Soleil in my opinion. I was on the edge of my seat for the death defying performances and the flexibility of the acrobats is mind boggling.')]"
